# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project presents a detailed end-to-end analysis of telecom customer churn. The primary objective is to identify key patterns and actionable insights that can help the company reduce customer attrition and improve retention strategies.

# Tools:

Python: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

SQL: Applied for extracting insights and segmenting churn behavior.

Power BI: Used to create an interactive dashboard for visualization and business reporting.

# Objective

The goal of this analysis is to understand the behavior and characteristics of customers who are most likely to churn and to uncover the main reasons driving that churn.

# Process Overview

Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)

Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed outliers.

Created derived variables where needed to improve analysis accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

Analyzed trends in customer tenure, internet type, and contract preferences.

Identified high-churn segments based on service type, geography, and pricing.

Insight Generation (SQL)

Wrote analytical queries to summarize customer behavior.

Filtered and grouped data to understand churn by category, region, and churn reasons.

Visualization (Power BI)

Developed a dashboard with interactive filters and key performance indicators.

Visualized churn rates by contract type, service features, customer categories, and regions.

# Key Insights

Customers on month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate, indicating instability in short-term users.

A large proportion of churned customers had no value-added deals, suggesting an opportunity to reduce churn through better bundling.

Users with DSL internet services were more likely to churn compared to fiber optic users, highlighting potential service quality issues.

Most churned customers cited better offers or devices from competitors as their reason for leaving.

Interestingly, churned users had slightly higher average tenure, suggesting dissatisfaction builds over time.

# Results

Total number of customers analyzed: 6,418

Overall churn rate: 26.99%

Churn rate among month-to-month users: 46.5%

Churned customers with no value deal: ~55%

Highest average monthly charges found in: Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir
